Rich Pauloo {#title}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have developed [groundwater flow and contaminant transport models](https://richpauloo.github.io/research/), made [pipelines that process and display environmental data from remote sensor networks in near-real time](http://ucwater.org/gw_obs), created [interactive dashboards that make sense of massive datasets](https://richpauloo.github.io/2019-09-16-A-water-quality-portal-for-California/), and built [packages for R](https://github.com/richpauloo/textme).  

Currently searching for positions in government and industry where I can work on challenging, data-intensive issues facing California's water future.
